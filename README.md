Simple project to show examples of how to do things in both Ruby and Groovy.  Most of the examples are inspired by Ruby examples found on google plus by: https://plus.google.com/u/0/+EmadElsaid/posts and found in his gists https://gist.github.com/blazeeboy


This examples are me mainly just playing around and learning, they may not necessarily be the the best way to do things.
